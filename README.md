# Specify

Laravel 13 system where humans approve AI actions on code repos. AI proposes stories and edits, humans gate them, AI executes against real git repos.

## Quickstart

```bash
composer setup            # install deps, copy .env, key:generate, migrate, npm build
composer dev              # serve + queue + pail + vite, all at once
composer test             # pint --test + php artisan test
```

Requires PHP `^8.4`, Node, and SQLite by default. `composer setup` creates `database/database.sqlite` and runs migrations on first run.

## Domain at a glance

`Workspace -> Project -> Feature -> Story -> AcceptanceCriterion / Scenario -> Plan -> Task -> Subtask`.

- **Workspace** — tenant boundary, owned by a User. `Team` is workspace-scoped (M:N via `team_user`).
- **Story** — product-owner unit of value; carries kind, actor, intent, outcome, `revision` (auto-bumps on product edits), `description`, `notes`, acceptance criteria, and scenarios.
- **Plan** — implementation interpretation of a Story. `stories.current_plan_id` points at the active Plan; previous Plans remain history.
- **Task** — delivery work item under a Plan. A Task may reference an acceptance criterion or scenario, but it is not defined as one acceptance criterion. Subtasks are the executor's step list.
- **Approval is the core reframe.** `ApprovalPolicy` (Story/Project/Workspace cascade, configurable `required_approvals` threshold) plus immutable `StoryApproval` and `PlanApproval` logs. Story approval gates the product contract; current Plan approval gates execution. Tasks and Subtasks don't gate; the diff-review surface is the PR.

See `docs/adr/` for the load-bearing decisions in detail.

## How a run works

```
Story submitted and approved
  → Plan generated/replaced (GenerateTasksJob → TasksGenerator agent, structured output)
  → current Plan submitted and approved
  → Subtasks dispatched (ExecuteSubtaskJob)
      → SubtaskRunPipeline: prepare workdir → checkout branch → executor edits
      → commit → diff → push → open PR
  → mark Done → cascade
```

Product edits reopen Story approval and current Plan approval. Plan/Task/Subtask edits reopen Plan approval. `AgentRun` records every dispatch (polymorphic `runnable`, polymorphic `authorizing_approval`, append-only): task-generation runs may authorise against `StoryApproval`; execution runs authorise against `PlanApproval`.

## Pluggable executors

`Executor` interface — `needsWorkingDirectory()`, `execute(Subtask, ?workingDir, ?Repo, ?workingBranch): ExecutionResult`.

- `LaravelAiExecutor` — describe-only, wraps the `TaskExecutor` agent (no fs mutation).
- `CliExecutor` — generic; runs any one-shot agent CLI (claude, codex, gemini, aider) in cwd, observes via `git status`.
- `FakeExecutor` — test double.

Bound by `specify.executor.driver`. See `config/specify.php` for all knobs (`runs_path`, `git.{name,email}`, `workspace.{push_after_commit, open_pr_after_push}`, `github.api_base`, `executor.{driver, cli.{command, timeout}}`).

## Repos

`Repo` is workspace-scoped with a `provider` enum (Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket/Generic) and encrypted `access_token` / `webhook_secret`. M:N with `Project` via `project_repo` (`role`, `is_primary`).

`PullRequestProvider` interface; drivers exist for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. `ExecuteSubtaskJob` opens a PR after push (config-gated); failures are recorded as `pull_request_error` and don't fail the run.

Branch naming: `specify/{feature-slug}/{story-slug}`; race-mode siblings add `-by-{driver}`.
